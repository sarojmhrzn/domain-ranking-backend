## Description

NestJS backend that fetches domain popularity rankings using the Tranco Ranking API, stores results in a PostgreSQL (Neon) database, and serves cached ranking data to optimize performance and reduce API calls.

## Features

- Fetch Real-time Domain Rankings
  Queries domain rank history from the public Tranco API:

```bash
https://tranco-list.eu/api/ranks/domain/<domain>
```

- Caching in PostgreSQL
  When a domain is queried:
  - If cached data exists and was updated within the last 24 hours, results are served instantly without calling Tranco again.
  - Otherwise, fresh data is fetched and stored.

- Support Multi-Domain Comparison
  A user can request multiple domains at once using commas, e.g.: and backend returns chart ready ranking datasets for each domain
  ```bash
  GET /ranking/google.com,facebook.com,github.com
  ```
- Sequelize + Neon Hosting
  Uses Sequelize Models with automatic migration and connects to Neon Severless Postgres.

## API Endpoints

- Single Domain
  ```bash
  GET /ranking/google.com
  ```
- Multiple Domain
  ```bash
  GET /ranking/google.com,facebook.com
  ```
